# Database for Rieltor booking Service

Hi, everyone!

My name is Aimar and I made a project for a real estate website that can help you to book the rieltors and etc.

The main subjects are client and rieltor, where they can make a contract, and service can track the rieltors' salaries and profit for the company itself.

I made an ERD (Entity-Relationship Diagram) and necessary queries for creating tables, inserting data and making some specific actions depending on requirements.

Thanks for attention!
